## Vectors and Products

A plane vector x in ℝ<sup>2</sup> has the representation 

x = x<sub>1</sub>i + x<sub>2</sub>j. 

A space vector y in ℝ<sup>3</sup> has the representation

y = y<sub>1</sub>i + y<sub>2</sub>i + y<sub>3</sub>k

Zero Vector is [0, 0, 0]

If a vector x is multiplied by a scalar a: 
* ax = [ax<sub>1</sub>, ax<sub>2</sub>, ax<sub>3</sub>]


DEFINITIONS
* A linear combination w = ax + by + cz is *non-trivial* iff one of the coefficients is not a 0. 
* The set of all linear combinations of a set of vectors is their span
* A set of vectors is linearly dependent if the zero vector is expressible as a non-trivial linear combination of the vectors in set
* Two non-zero vectors x and y are linearly dependent iff they are *parallel*. i.e. there exists a constant c where y = cx
 * Three non-zero vectors x,y, and z are linearly dependent iff they are *coplanar*. i.e. if x and y are parallel or there exist constants b and c such that z = bx + cy

Given points P and Q where P = [x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>] and Q = [y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>]

Vector PQ = [y<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>- x<sub>3</sub>]


Length of vector X is defined as |x| = sqrt(x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>)

Let u be the angle between vectors x and y  x dot y = |x||y|cos(u)

Two vectors are perpendicular if the dot product of x and y = 0

Cross Product of x and y is the determinant of [i j k; x<sub>1</sub> x<sub>2</sub> x<sub>3</sub>; y<sub>1</sub> y<sub>2</sub> y<sub>3</sub>]

x cross y = |x||y|sin(u)lines
