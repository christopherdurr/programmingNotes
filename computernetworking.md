## Chapter 1: Computer Networks and The Internet

## 1.1

Devices hooked up to the internet are called **hosts** or **end systems**. 

These end systems are connected by **communication links** and **packet switches**

**Transmission Rate**: How fast a system can transmit data in bits/second

**Packet Switch**: takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication
links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. 

Two types of packet switches:

* Routers: Used in network core
* Link-Layer switches: Used in access networks 

**Route/Path**: The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from
the sending end system to the receiving end system

**Internet Service Provider**: How end systems access the internet

**Protocol**: Controls the sending and receiving of information within the internet

* **Transmission Control Protocol(TCP)**:
* **Internet Protocol(IP)**: Specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received. **TCP/IP**

**Internet Standards**: Created by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). Standard documents are called requests for comments (**RFC**)

**Application Programming Interface (API)**: Specifies how a program running on one end system asks
the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system. 

**Network Protocol**: Defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between
two or more communicating entities
