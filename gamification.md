#Gamification
##Gamification in Education by Joey J. Lee and Jessica Hammer
Analysts predict it will be a multi-billion dollar industry by 2015. So far, gamification has been used as a way to promote a business or a product.
However, there is a huge potential for gamification as it may motivate students to learn better and care more about schooling. 

* What is gamification?
    * Normal environment fails to engage students
    * Disengagement from school happens at social and emotional levels
    * Gamification exists on the *micro-scale*, where individual teachers gamify their classrooms.
    * On the other hand, schools like *quest to learn*, a charter school in NYC, uses gamification across all their classes
* How to apply gamification to learning?
    * **Cognition**
    * Games allow players to explore through experimentation and discovery
    * Games deliver concrete challengs that are perfectly tailored to the player's skill level
    * ** Emotional**
    * Gamification provides students with immediate rewards as opposed to vague, long-term benefits
    * Games help players persist through negative emotional experiences and even transform them into positive ones
    * In games, you fail quickly and repeatedly until you succeed. In school, however, failure is high stakes
    * **Social**
    * Games allow students to try on new identities and roles
* Risks/Benefits
    * **Benefits**
    * Gamification can motivate students to engage in the classroom
    * Give teachers better tools to guide and reward students
    * **Risks**
    * Teaches students that they should learn only when provided with external rewards
    * Making play mandatory might create rule-based experiences that feel like school
