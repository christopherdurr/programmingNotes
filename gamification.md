#Gamification
##Gamification in Education by Joey J. Lee and Jessica Hammer
Analysts predict it will be a multi-billion dollar industry by 2015. So far, gamification has been used as a way to promote a business or a product.
However, there is a huge potential for gamification as it may motivate students to learn better and care more about schooling. 

* What is gamification?
    * Normal environment fails to engage students
    * Disengagement from school happens at social and emotional levels
    * Gamification exists on the *micro-scale*, where individual teachers gamify their classrooms.
    * On the other hand, schools like *quest to learn*, a charter school in NYC, uses gamification across all their classes
* How to apply gamification to learning?
    * **Cognition**
    * Games allow players to explore through experimentation and discovery
    * Games deliver concrete challengs that are perfectly tailored to the player's skill level
    * **Emotional**
    * Gamification provides students with immediate rewards as opposed to vague, long-term benefits
    * Games help players persist through negative emotional experiences and even transform them into positive ones
    * In games, you fail quickly and repeatedly until you succeed. In school, however, failure is high stakes
    * **Social**
    * Games allow students to try on new identities and roles
* Risks/Benefits
    * **Benefits**
    * Gamification can motivate students to engage in the classroom
    * Give teachers better tools to guide and reward students
    * **Risks**
    * Teaches students that they should learn only when provided with external rewards
    * Making play mandatory might create rule-based experiences that feel like school

##Why students engage in "gaming the system" by Ryan Baker, Neil Heffernan, and Jason Walonoski

A number of students (studies suggest anywhere from 10% - 40% of students) engage in gaming behavior where they take advantage of the system's help and feedback mechanism instead of properly learning the material. 

Gaming the system consists of the following behaviors:

* quickly and repeatedly asking for help until the tutor gives the student the correct answer
* inputting a sequence of answer attempts quickly and systematically
* intentionally posting irrelevant material to online course discussion
* Working on material the student has already memorized

Some newer learning systems are able to identify when students are engaging in "gaming" behavior and notifies them. However, this still doesn't adress the root problem. Students will always try to find way to game a system, so we must figure out what their motivation is for doing so. 

There are many hypotheses as to why students engage in gaming behavior. These include:

1. Performance Goals
2. Desire for more control
3. Disliking mathematics
4. Disliking computers
5. Disliking the learning environment
6. Believing mathematics is not important
7. Believing success in math is due to innate ability and not practice
8. Believing the tutor is not helpful
9. Believing the computer/system is uncaring
10. Lack of educational self-drive
11. Passive-agressiveness
12. Frustration
13. Anxiety

When ranked by teachers, they found that the top three explanations for teachers were:

1. Frustration
2. Lack of self-drive
3. Performance Goals

However, the conclusion shows that the main reason for gaming the system is disliking the subject matter.
