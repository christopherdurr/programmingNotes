## Chapter 2.1: Sets

A **set** is an unordained collection of objects, called *elements* or *members* of the set. 

a ∈ A denotes that a is an element of set A

Ex. The set V of all vowels is V = {a,e,i,o,u}

Sets can have completely unrelated elements. For instance, {2, John, pi, z} is a set

**Set Builder Notation**

Ex. O =  {x | x is an odd positive integer less than 10}

There are several sets that play a key role in discrete mathematics:

* N: Set of natural numbers
* Z: Set of integers
* Z+: Set of positive integers
* Q: Set of rational numbers
* R: Set of real numbers
* R+: Set of positive real numbers
* C: Set of complex numbers

Two sets are equal if they have the same elements

**Empty Set**/**Null Set**: A set that has no elements

**Singleton Set**: A set with a single element

**Subset**: A ⊆ B. Every element of A is also in B

For every nonempty set S, it is guaranteed to have at least two subsets: 
* The empty set
* The set itself

Put simply, ∅ ⊆ S and S ⊆ S

**Proper Subset**: A ⊂ B and A /= B

**Cardinality**: Number of elements of the set

**Power Set**: Given a set S, the power set is the set of all subsets of the set S. It is denoted by P(S).

A set with n elements has 2<sup>n</sup> elements in the power set.
